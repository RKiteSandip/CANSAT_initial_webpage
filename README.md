# CANSAT_initial_webpage
This is the initial work for the web page that was supposed to be used for CANSAT where the plots and telemetry data will be displayed

But unfortunately we could not made it to the second round by a marginal score, so the progress on this webpage which was supposed to be the interactor between the CANSAT and GROUND STATION cannot be completed
